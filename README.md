# Mechman WhatsApp bot and meeting CRM

A deterministic WhatsApp enquiry bot, custom meeting scheduler, and authenticated CRM dashboard for Mechman Solutions. The bot copy and routing are hard-coded from `mechmansolution.com`; no LLM is used at runtime...
## Included

- Natural A–F WhatsApp flow for Products, Services, Solutions, About, Contact, and Book a meeting.
- Open-ended qualification questions and a direct custom-booking link at the end of every branch.
- Neonize linked-device pairing with a browser QR page; the transport is isolated for a later WABA adapter.
- Simple Name, Phone, Email, and Date/Time meeting form with server-generated availability, business-hour validation, and conflict protection.
- Password-protected dashboard with analytics, meeting filters, status/stage management, CRM contacts, and audit history.
- Configurable WhatsApp reminders before calls and 1-day/3-day follow-ups, with editable timing, templates, and persistent delivery history.
- SQLite persistence with WAL mode, parameterized queries, transactions, schema migration, and message idempotency.
- Responsive React interface and a production multi-stage Docker image.
- Automated conversation, booking, auth, CRM, and migration tests.

See [BOT_FLOW.md](BOT_FLOW.md) for the WhatsApp conversation and [SITE_DECODE.md](SITE_DECODE.md) for the website-derived knowledge map.

## Local setup

Requirements: Python 3.10+, Node.js 20+, and a WhatsApp number that can be linked as a companion device.

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install -e '.[dev]'

cd portal
npm install
npm run build
cd ..

cp .env.example .env
```

Set a unique `JWT_SECRET` and strong `ADMIN_PASSWORD` in your environment. This project intentionally does not auto-load `.env`; export it with your process manager or shell. For a local shell:

```bash
set -a
source .env
set +a
mechman-dashboard
```

Open:

- Dashboard: `http://localhost:8000/login`
- Booking form: `http://localhost:8000/book`
- API documentation: `http://localhost:8000/docs`

The first run creates the configured administrator. Changing `ADMIN_PASSWORD` later does not silently overwrite an existing account.

## Pair WhatsApp

1. Sign in to the dashboard.
2. Open **WhatsApp Pairing**.
3. On the phone, open **WhatsApp → Settings → Linked Devices → Link a Device**.
4. Scan the displayed QR.

The linked session is stored in `NEONIZE_SESSION_DB`. Treat that database as a credential, persist it on an encrypted/durable volume, and do not run two bot processes against the same session file.

The CLI-only pairing flow remains available with `mechman-bot`, including `mechman-bot --pair-phone 919913789065` for a phone link code.

## Reminders and follow-ups

Open **Settings** in the dashboard to configure:

- Whether reminders are enabled and how many minutes before the meeting they send (60 by default).
- Whether follow-ups are enabled and the comma-separated delays (1 and 3 days by default).
- The natural-language reminder and follow-up templates.

Supported placeholders are `{name}`, `{date}`, `{time}`, `{minutes}`, and `{days}`. Reminders only send for confirmed or scheduled meetings. Follow-ups send for confirmed, scheduled, or completed meetings. Each delivery is recorded with a unique meeting/type key, so a restart cannot send the same message twice.

## Configuration

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `NEONIZE_SESSION_DB` | `data/neonize-session.db` | Persistent linked-device credentials |
| `BOT_DATABASE` | `data/mechman-bot.db` | Conversations, CRM, meetings, users, and history |
| `PUBLIC_BOOKING_URL` | `http://localhost:5173/book` | Booking link sent by the bot |
| `JWT_SECRET` | none | Required; at least 32 characters |
| `JWT_EXPIRE_MINUTES` | `720` | Dashboard session lifetime |
| `ADMIN_USERNAME` | `admin` | Initial administrator username |
| `ADMIN_PASSWORD` | none | Required; at least 10 characters |
| `MEETING_DURATION_MINUTES` | `60` | Slot length: 30, 45, 60, 90, or 120 |
| `WHATSAPP_AUTOSTART` | `true` | Start Neonize with the dashboard |
| `TEAM_ALERT_NUMBER` | empty | Optional staff alert destination |
| `LOG_LEVEL` | `INFO` | Application logging level |

Current booking hours are Monday–Saturday, 9:00 AM–6:30 PM Asia/Kolkata. They are defined centrally in `mechman_bot/api.py` so the slot endpoint and server-side validation cannot drift apart.

## Development

Run the API and Vite separately for hot reload:

```bash
# terminal 1
WHATSAPP_AUTOSTART=false mechman-dashboard

# terminal 2
cd portal
npm run dev
```

Vite proxies `/api` and `/healthz` to port 8000. Set `PUBLIC_BOOKING_URL=http://localhost:5173/book` during this workflow.

Quality checks:

```bash
ruff format --check .
ruff check .
pytest
cd portal && npm run build
```

## Docker

```bash
docker build -t mechman-crm .
docker run --env-file .env -p 8000:8000 -v mechman-data:/app/data mechman-crm
```

## Production path

Neonize is a community WhatsApp automation SDK, not the official Meta Cloud API. Review WhatsApp/Meta terms before production use. The conversation engine and CRM do not depend on Neonize, so a future WABA webhook/sender can replace only the transport adapter.
