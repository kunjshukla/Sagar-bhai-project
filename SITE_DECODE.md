# Mechman Solutions website decode

Scope: only pages on `mechmansolution.com` were used for company and offering facts. The Neonize repository is used only for WhatsApp implementation details.

## Positioning

Mechman Solutions presents itself as an Autodesk Authorized Channel Partner and Autodesk Authorized Training Center founded in Vadodara in 2015. Its core promise is practical CAD/CAM software, implementation, training, post-processors, and programming support delivered by people with CNC shop-floor experience.

The strongest conversion idea on the homepage is: send an actual component and see it programmed live in Fusion 360 or PowerMill. That is why the bot drives every route toward a technical meeting/demo instead of merely dumping links.

## Audience

- Small and mid-size job shops moving away from manual programming or disconnected tools.
- Mold and die, automotive tooling, aerospace, precision engineering, medical, Swiss, and high-volume component manufacturers.
- Individual learners, freshers, working programmers, and corporate teams seeking Autodesk training.
- Shops that need a new or corrected post-processor for common and complex machine configurations.

## Product map

## Website inconsistencies handled conservatively

- `/software/design/powershape/` returned 404, while the Die-Mold Design route served the live PowerShape page. The bot uses the live page's content and does not send the broken URL.
- `/service/cnc-programming-services/` returned a not-found page. The bot uses only the CNC programming description visible on the homepage.
- The site alternates between `mechmansolution@gmail.com` and `info@mechmansolution.com`. The bot displays the Gmail address shown on the homepage/contact page and retains the other as an alternate in code.
- Several “Solutions” URLs resolve to the corresponding product page. The bot therefore treats Solutions as need-based routing to products, not as separate offerings.
- Some page titles do not match their visible content. The bot trusts visible page content.
- The website lists office hours but exposes no live calendar or confirmed meeting capacity. The bot records a preferred slot and marks it pending human confirmation.
